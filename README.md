Takvim is a newspaper in Turkey and it is notorious for its fake news. Their subheads are the herald of pension increases which never come true.
I have found a text file that has all pension-related subheads of it on the web. In this piece of code, I calculated that if takvim newspaper subheads was true, what an average pension would be like.
